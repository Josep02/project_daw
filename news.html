                <h3> Tesla already accumulates 1.3 million reserves of the Cybertruck </h3>
                <img src="assets/imatges/cybertruck-1574435321.jpg" class="img">
                <p> Despite the delays to its launch and the absence of news about its update with promised
                    modifications to create a somewhat more rational car for production, reserves continue to accumulate
                    at Tesla and have already far exceeded one million orders. </p>

                <h3> Intel Sierra Forest-AP: The 128-core CPU that would compete with AMD Bergamo</h3>
                <p>
                    The first time we heard something from the Intel Sierra Forest-AP platform was in April, where it
                    was
                    only known that it would use the new LGA7529 socket, but now we know highly relevant information,
                    such
                    as that we would be facing Intel Xeon processors that will offer a configuration up to 128 cores.

                    Of course, they will be cores of low energy consumption, those for now known as E-Core (Efficient
                    Core),
                    which is basically the same strategy of AMD, since it will offer 128 cores and 256 threads through a
                    new
                    architecture baptized as <b>AMD Zen4c</b> to a 5nm manufacturing process by TSMC.

                <h3> AMD is also targeting a chip shortage through 2023 </h3>
                <p> El fabricante de los corazones de PS5 y XSX/S apunta a que los problemas de suministro de chips (y
                    por ende
                    de gráficas y procesadores) no mejorarán hasta, al menos, el 2023. </p>
